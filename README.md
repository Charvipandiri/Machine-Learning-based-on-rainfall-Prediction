# Machine Learning Based on Rainfall Prediction

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques by analyzing historical weather data. The model learns patterns from parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed to estimate the likelihood of rainfall.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether rainfall will occur based on past climate data. This system helps in weather forecasting, agricultural planning, and disaster management. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation and visualization.

## ✨ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Rainfall prediction based on weather attributes
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn 

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook
4. Run all cells to perform training and prediction.



## 📊 Project Status
